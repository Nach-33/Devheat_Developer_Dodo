# Problems Solved

```
- Share market investing is often encouraged nowadays, since not only does it beat inflation but seldom also brings exponential returns.

- Investing however can be a tedious task for many beginners since share trading platforms can often be overwhelming.

- This in turn restricts users, for it presents the risk of putting people's savings at stake.

- This is where paper trading or demo trading comes in to help.

- Using a demo account allows first time traders to experience and trade with an account that looks and acts similarly to the real online trading accounts traders use. 

- Users can also take the assistance of our trained AI, which can make calculated predictions based on the previous performance of a stock.
